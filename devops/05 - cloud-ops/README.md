## Sorry, I'm not familiar with Cloudformation but touched the Terrafom, I did this task with the Terraform usage, hope you're okay with that :)

## Also takes some time, during this taks I've asked some more experianced guys for help, but I totally understand what's happening in this .ts files and how it works

## Tasks

* Create an AWS account and protect the root user with MFA https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user_manage_mfa

> so did it :) MFA works for my account

* Create an EC2 instance, connect to it through SSH and install apache or nginx manually, terminate it then.

* Create an EC2 instance, provision software (apache/nginx) using Cloudformation, validate the installation, finally delete the stack. 
  Provide the resulting template as outcome of this task.

* (*) Given that we have a properly written Cloudformation template come up with an idea how we 
  can create and update a cloudformation stack based on this template automatically. Try to implement it.

## Questions

1. What the benefits of the cloud computing?

* Speed to market
* Scalability
* Cost Efficiency
* UI friendly
* etc.

2. What is the Infrastructure As Code? Pros/cons of it?

> So, for answering to this questions I went through this article https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/pros-and-cons-infrastructure-code and fully agree with the described concepts, not sure I need to copy/paste it here
