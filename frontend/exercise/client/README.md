## About <a name = "about"></a>

Application is implemented using HTML+CSS+JS+React+Typescript stack. Forms are validated via [`react-hook-form`](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form). [`rechart`](https://github.com/recharts/recharts) lib was used to visualize statistic by categories. Icons were imported from [`react-feather`](https://github.com/feathericons/react-feather) lib.

The application will contain 4 routes:

- `/expenses` - displays full expenses history, allows to perform CRUD operations on the expenses;
- `/add-expense` - form to add new expense. All the fields should be filled and the amount values should not be less than 0,01 in order to send the `POST` request;
- `/edit-expense/{id}` - form to update the existing expense. All the fields should be filled and the amount values should not be less than 0,01 in order to send the `POST` request. By default the input fields' values are set to the data of current expense;
- `/statistic` - shows statistic by category for each month present in expenses list. The total month spending, monthly categories expenses and categories spending chart are displayed on this page.
